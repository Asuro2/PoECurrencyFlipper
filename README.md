# PoE Currency Flipper  
Author: Breached

The PoE Currency Flipper is a mostly automated tool that helps you buy currency from players in trade chat. You then sell said purchased currency on poe.trade for example, to make a profit.

### USAGE

Feel free to use this tool as intended i.e. to assist with purchasing currency in game, however, please request permission for any other use.


### INSTALLATION

To install PoE Currency Flipper: 
1. Please go to the release page [here](https://github.com/Breached/PoECurrencyFlipper/releases "PoE Currency Flipper release page") and download the folder 'PoECurrencyFlipper.zip' from the latest release. 
2. Unzip the folder and place the resulting unzipped folder in a location of your choosing (e.g. C:\Program Files (x86) or D:\Users\Gazza732\Documents\My Games etc.). 
3. Launch 'PoE Currency Flipper.exe' as and when you want to use it.  

By default the tool is set to use the standalone PoE client 'PathOfExile_x64.exe'. To change this, use the 'Steam' and 'Standalone' buttons in the 'Game Client' section of the GUI.


### DONATIONS

If you like this tool and you want to make a donation because of it, you can do so [here](http://paypal.me/BreachedDev "Donation page for Breached"). Thank you very much in advance, it is much appreciated.

Also if you'd like to show you're appreciation with in-game currency donations, please let me know. Having seen a decrease in profits from making this tool widely available this would be very much appreciated, however, please do not feel you have to in the slightest.

Donations of any kind are not required however, they are just if you like the program and want to show your appreciation. If not then it is perfectly fine as the most important thing is that I've been able to develop something you can enjoy and that benefits you.
